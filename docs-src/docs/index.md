# CSC3206 Artificial Intelligence 202104 Assignment 1

## Aim

This assignment requires you to create agents/players to play the snake game using search algorithms.

## Requirements

1. Create two agents, one using uninformed search algorithm, and another using informed search algorithm.
2. Complete at least one of the following challenges. Additional challenges will contribute to bonus marks.
   1. One food at any time; Non-increasing snake length; Snake length of one; reaching at least 15 points
   2. One food at any time; Increasing snake length with food; Starting snake length of one; reaching at least 10 points
   3. Two food generated when no food is available on the maze; Increasing snake length with food; Starting snake length of one; reaching at least 10 points
3. Submit a report explaining the problem formulation and the search algorithm, show and discuss the results of the agents.
