Human mode In Human mode, you will control the snake's direction using the keyboard. This mode is to help you to be familiar with the game to design the agent to solve the problem. Click or press P to start the game. Use the arrow keys \u25c2 \u25b8 \u25be \u25b4 to control the direction of the snake. Each food eaten by the snake will contribute a point. If the snake hits the wall or bites itself, the snake will die and the game is over. You may change the moving speed of the snake before you start the game or when you pause the game. Moving speed == 0 The snake will move one square with each keypress. Moving speed > 0 The snake will move according to the specified speed. The direction of the snake will be updated if any arrow key is pressed. Agent mode In Agent mode, the snake's direction will be controlled by an agent/a player/a code that you create. Choose the agent/player from the dropdown list. (Refresh the list if your agent is not in the list after you set it up correctly following the instructions in Use your script as agent/player ) Choose between Step-by-step mode or Automatic progression mode. Step-by-step When the solution is returned by the agent/player, the next game state will not be sent immediate to prompt the agent/player to provide the next solution. The agent/player will only be provided with the next game state when Next step button is clicked. Automatic progression When the solution is returned by the agent/player, the next game state will be sent immediately to prompt the agent/player to provide the next solution. No user interaction is required. Click or press P to start the game. Step-by-step The current game state will be sent to the agent/player when Next step button is clicked.

To create a new agent/player, create a directory in the players directory, for example, a directory with the name of super_player . The agent/player is the player.py file inside that directory. snake-game app players super_players player.py Code format The player.py file should consist of the class Player as structured as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 class Player (): name = \"testing player\" informed = False group = \"Children of Odin\" members = [ [ \"Thor\" , \"12834823\" ], [ \"Loki\" , \"98854678\" ], [ \"Hela\" , \"87654654\" ] ] def __init__ ( self , setup ): ... def run ( self , problem ): ... return solution , search_tree Class name The name of the class must be Player .

For informed search 1 informed = True For uninformed search 1 informed = False Group information Include your group information as the class attributes for the Player class. This includes your group name ( group ) and group members ( members ). __init__() function The __init__ function is the function to initiate the player. Apart from self , the function will also receive setup as an input parameter. The format of the setup is 1 2 3 4 { maze_size : [ int , int ], static_snake_length : bool } maze_size is an array of length two. The first item is the number of rows and the second item is the number of columns of the maze. static_snake_length is a boolean object to indicate if the snake length is static ( True ) or dynamic ( False ). run() function The run function is the function to implement the search algorithm. The function will take the input parameter of problem , which contains the current game state including the snake locations ( snake_locations ), current direction of the snake ( current_direction ), and the food locations ( food_locations ) in the following format: 1 2 3 4 5 { snake_locations : [[ int , int ],[ int , int ], ... ], current_direction : str , food_locations : [[ int , int ],[ int , int ], ... ], } snake_locations is an array of the locations of the snake's body, starting from the head to the tail. The locations are given in the form of the coordinates [x,y] , i.e. [column, row] , with [0,0] at the top left corner of the maze. As an example, for a maze of 5 rows and 6 columns, the top right corner is [5,0] , the bottom left corner is [0,4] , and the bottom right corner is [5,4] . current_direction is the current direction of the snake, specified as north n , south s , west w , or east e . food_locations is an array of the locations of the food on the game field. The locations are specified in the form of coordinates identical to snake_locations . The run function is expected to return two variables, solution and search_tree . solution is the series of actions for the snake from the current location to capture the food.

Be reminded that these questions are just guidelines and you should not just directly answer these questions.","title":"Submission file"},{"location":"submission/#marks-distribution","text":"Criteria % Remark Functional codes 20 Your code should work without throwing exceptions Scored points 10 This is based on the amount of points your agents/players scored during the game relative to other groups Content correctness 20 The contents in your report should be correct Content continuity 15 Your report should have continuity from one section to the next section Report representation 15 Your report should be consistent and able to communicate the contents effectively Discussion/Analysis 20 The discussion and the analysis should be clear and logical Total 100 \u00d7 \\(\\frac{15}{100}\\) = 15 This assignment contributes to 15% of the course","title":"Marks distribution"},{"location":"ui/","text":"UI Overview text { font-size: 50px; text-anchor: middle; dominant-baseline: middle; } rect { fill: white; fill-opacity: 0.5; stroke: teal; stroke-width: 10; } Game field Point display Game controls /settings Logs","title":"UI"},{"location":"ui/#ui-overview","text":"text { font-size: 50px; text-anchor: middle; dominant-baseline: middle; } rect { fill: white; fill-opacity: 0.5; stroke: teal; stroke-width: 10; } Game field Point display Game controls /settings Logs","title":"UI Overview"}]}
